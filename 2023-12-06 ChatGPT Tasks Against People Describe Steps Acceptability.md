Take a deep breath and think step by step.
1. A person will ask a large language model to do steps of tasks.
2. The model is in control of a robot API.
3. The model will get accurate text descriptions of the vision system and will have arms that can manipulate objects.
4. The model will have the capability of communicating verbally and visually with people, as well as communicating with people over the phone.
5. The model will not get access to specialized technology specific to the task such as databases or the web.
6. The model will not be asked to move objects outside the scope of the robot’s physical capabilities.
